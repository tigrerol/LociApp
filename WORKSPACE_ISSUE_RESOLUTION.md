# LociApp Workspace Issue Resolution

## Problem
The LociApp.xcworkspace shows SuperMemoKit but not the LociApp project itself, making it impossible to add SuperMemoKit as a dependency.

## Root Cause
The workspace configuration is referencing the correct paths, but Xcode isn't displaying the LociApp project in the navigator.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use LociApp Project Directly (Recommended)
Instead of using the workspace, open the LociApp project directly and add SuperMemoKit as a local package dependency:

1. **Open LociApp project directly**:
   ```bash
   open LociApp/LociApp.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Add SuperMemoKit as local package**:
   - In Xcode, select the LociApp project (blue icon)
   - Go to Package Dependencies tab
   - Click the "+" button
   - Choose "Add Local..."
   - Navigate to and select the `SuperMemoKit` folder (at the same level as LociApp folder)
   - Click "Add Package"

3. **Add SuperMemoKit to LociApp target**:
   - Select the LociApp target
   - Go to General tab → Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content
   - Click "+" → Add SuperMemoKit

### Option 2: Recreate Workspace
If you prefer using a workspace:

1. **Create new workspace**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf LociApp.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Create new workspace in Xcode**:
   - File → New → Workspace
   - Save as "LociApp" in the main directory
   - Add LociApp.xcodeproj by dragging it into the workspace
   - Add SuperMemoKit folder by dragging it into the workspace

### Option 3: Manual Project Integration
If packages don't work, we can copy SuperMemoKit source directly into the LociApp project.

## Current Status
- ✅ SuperMemoKit package exists and builds successfully
- ✅ LociApp code is updated to use SuperMemoKit
- ❌ SuperMemoKit not linked to LociApp target (causing linker errors)
- ❌ Workspace showing only SuperMemoKit

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Try Option 1 (direct project approach) first
2. If that doesn't work, try Option 2 (recreate workspace)
3. Option 3 as last resort

## Files That Need SuperMemoKit
- `Models.swift` - SuperMemoService uses SuperMemoAlgorithm
- `Views.swift` - ScheduleView displays SuperMemoKitInfo

## Expected Build Errors Without Proper Linking
```
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
"SuperMemoKit.SuperMemoKitInfo.versionString.unsafeMutableAddressor"
"SuperMemoKit.SuperMemoKitInfo.features.unsafeMutableAddressor"
```

These errors confirm the code is correct but the package isn't linked to the target.
