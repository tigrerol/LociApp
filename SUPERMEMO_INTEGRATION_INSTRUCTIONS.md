# SuperMemoKit Integration Instructions for LociApp

## Current Status
✅ SuperMemoKit package is correctly added to the workspace and resolved  
✅ LociApp code has been updated to use SuperMemoKit  
❌ SuperMemoKit is not linked to the LociApp target (causing linker errors)

## Required Steps to Complete Integration

### Option 1: Using Xcode (Recommended)

1. **Open the LociApp workspace**:
   ```bash
   open LociApp.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Add SuperMemoKit as a package dependency**:
   - In Xcode, select the **LociApp project** in the navigator (blue icon)
   - Select the **LociApp target** (under TARGETS)
   - Go to **General tab**
   - Scroll down to **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**
   - Click the **+** button
   - Choose **Add Package Dependency**
   - Select **"Add Local..."**
   - Navigate to and select the `SuperMemoKit` folder
   - Click **Add Package**
   - Ensure **SuperMemoKit** is selected and click **Add Package**

3. **Verify the integration**:
   - Build the project (⌘+B)
   - Run on simulator to test
   - Check that the Schedule tab shows SuperMemoKit version information

### Option 2: Using Swift Package Manager Resolution File

If Option 1 doesn't work, try this alternative:

1. **Create Package.resolved file**:
   ```bash
   cd LociApp/LociApp.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm
   ```

2. **Add this Package.resolved content**:
   ```json
   {
     "pins" : [
       {
         "identity" : "supermemokit",
         "kind" : "localSourceControl",
         "location" : "../../../../../SuperMemoKit",
         "state" : {
           "path" : "../../../../../SuperMemoKit"
         }
       }
     ],
     "version" : 2
   }
   ```

3. **Clean and rebuild**:
   - In Xcode: Product → Clean Build Folder
   - Build again (⌘+B)

## What to Expect After Successful Integration

### In LociApp Schedule Tab:
- Scroll to bottom of schedule list
- You should see a "SuperMemo Algorithm" section
- Version: "SuperMemoKit v1.0.0 (2025-07-10)"
- Enhanced features list including:
  - 90-day interval cap
  - Accuracy bias multiplier
  - Load balancing support
  - Enhanced spaced repetition

### Enhanced SuperMemo Features Now Active:
- **90-day interval cap**: Prevents exponentially long review intervals
- **Accuracy bias**: Cards with poor accuracy get more frequent reviews
- **Load balancing**: Review dates are distributed to avoid overload
- **Enhanced algorithm**: Same algorithm used in PAOCards

## Troubleshooting

### If build still fails:
1. Clean derived data: Xcode → Settings → Locations → Derived Data → Delete
2. Restart Xcode
3. Ensure SuperMemoKit folder is at the same level as LociApp.xcworkspace
4. Try adding the package dependency again

### If SuperMemoKit version doesn't appear:
1. Check that `import SuperMemoKit` is in Views.swift
2. Verify SuperMemoKit is properly linked in target dependencies
3. Check console for any import errors

## Verification Commands

Test that everything works:
```bash
# Build from command line (should succeed)
xcodebuild -workspace LociApp.xcworkspace -scheme LociApp -configuration Debug -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,id=0D53A25F-4151-4C6C-A751-D51A01EBB28D" build

# Test SuperMemoKit independently
cd SuperMemoKit && swift test
```

## Files Modified
- ✅ `Models.swift` - Updated to use SuperMemoKit
- ✅ `Views.swift` - Added version display in ScheduleView  
- ✅ `LociApp.xcworkspace` - Added SuperMemoKit package
- ❌ **LociApp target dependencies** - Needs manual addition in Xcode
