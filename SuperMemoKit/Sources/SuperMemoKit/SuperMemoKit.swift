/// SuperMemoKit - Enhanced SuperMemo algorithm implementation

/// This package provides an enhanced version of the SuperMemo-2 spaced repetition algorithm
/// with improvements for practical memory training applications.

/// Key enhancements over basic SuperMemo-2:
/// - 90-day interval cap to prevent exponential growth
/// - Accuracy bias multiplier based on historical performance
/// - Load balancing support for review scheduling
/// - Separation of practice sessions vs due reviews
